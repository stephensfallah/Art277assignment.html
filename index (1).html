  <h3>Travelling in Depression</h3>

    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
    became interested in language.
    <p style="font-size: 10px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      It began with French,which taught me the importance of
      pronunciation.
      
      I remember on ceaskingastore owner in Paris
      where Ruedes Pyramideswas.But when I pronounced it
      
      
      PYR–a–midesinstead of pyr–A–mides,with more accenton
      the A,she looked at mebewildered.
      <p style="font-size: 10px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In the eighth grade,I became fascinated with Spanish and
      aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
      
      Baseball in Spanish,for example, is béisbol, which looks
      different but sounds nearly the same.
      
      This was incredible to
      meas it made speech and comprehension more fluid,and even today If indthatcognates
      
      come to the rescue when I forgethow to say something in Spanish.<a href="malito: stephensfallah14@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a></p>
       <p style="font-size: 10px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Then, in high school,I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese
       
       .As Is tudied Chines eatmy
       school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing froma character,the meaning is lost.
       
       oved howb long words were formed by combining simpler characters,so Huǒ (火) meaning
       
       fire and Shān (山) meaning mounta in can be joined to create Huǒ shān (火山), which means
       
       volcano. I love spending hours at a timepracticing the characters and I can feel the beauty
       and rhythmas I formthem.</p>
